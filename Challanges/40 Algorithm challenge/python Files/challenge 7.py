#Write an algorithm that:
#   •Asks the user for the distance (in metres).
#   •Asks the user for the time in seconds that a journey was completed in.
#   •Calculates and outputs the average speed using a function.
dis = int(input("please enter the distance in meaters: "))
num2 = int(input("please enter the time in seconds: "))

print (str(dis / num2)+"m/s")
