#   • Calculate the correct price of the fuel they have taken. 
#   • Ask how much money they have handed over and calculate the amount of change they are due. 
#   • Finally, ask them if they have a loyalty card and if they do calculate how many points they should have added to it using the following:
#     1 point for every litre of fuel they’ve taken plus 
#     1 point for every full pound they’ve paid. 
#   • If the number of points they get is more than 100 they get a bonus 10% extra points.
