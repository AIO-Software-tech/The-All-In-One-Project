#Challenge 39
#A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students.
#The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication.
#The system should ask studentâ€™s name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10.
#Scores from the quiz should be stored and added to when a student takes a new quiz.
#Write an algorithm for the process described above.
