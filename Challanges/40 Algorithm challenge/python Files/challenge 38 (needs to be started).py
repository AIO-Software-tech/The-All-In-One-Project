#Challenge 38
#The company also offers a saving plan. Customers pay a fixed amount each year into the savings plan. 
#At the end of each year, the company adds the value of the savings plan at the start of the year to the amount paid, and then adds interest of 10% to obtain the final value for the year.
#For example, if a customer saves Â£100 each year, the value of the savings plan for 5 years is shown in the table below.
#Year Start Paid in Interest Final
#1 0.00 100.00 10.00 110.00
#2 110.00 100.00 21.00 231.00
#3 231.00 100.00 33.10 364.10
#4 364.10 100.00 46.41 510.51
#5 510.51 100.00 61.05 671.56
#Write an algorithm which allows the user to input the amount saved each year and the number of years, and the outputs the growth of the savings plan in the format shown above.
