# The 40 Algorithm Challenge

In school we were give the 40 Algorithm Challenge

This was a challenge to make 40 algorithms

## All The Challenges

#### Challenge 1

Design a program which asks the user to input their name, age and favourite colour.

#### Challenge 2

The program asks the user to input their first name. The program then outputs the users first
name

#### Challenge 3

The program asks the user to input their surname and then their first name. The program then
outputs the user’s first name and then their surname separately. 

#### Challenge 4

The program asks the user to input their first name and then their surname. The program then
outputs the user’s first name and then their surname on the same line. 

#### Challenge 5

The program asks the user to input two numbers. The program adds them together and then
outputs the total.

#### Challenge 6

The program asks the user to input two numbers. The program will then output:

* The two numbers added together followed by…
* The two numbers multiplied together.

#### Challenge 7

Write an algorithm that:
* Asks the user for the distance (in metres).
* Asks the user for the time in seconds that a journey was completed in.
* Calculates and outputs the average speed using a function.

#### Challenge 8

The program asks the user to input how many minutes and texts they have used in the last month
and then outputs the total cost of the bill. This is calculated by working out:
* The total cost of the minutes (at £0.10 per minute) and….
* Adding this to the total cost of the texts (at £0.05 per text) and….
* Adding on an additional monthly charge of £10.00.

#### Challenge 9

Write an algorithm that:
* Stores a random first name as a variable.
* Asks the user to input their first name.
* If it is the same as the stored name, outputs 'You’re cool.'
* Otherwise outputs 'Nice to meet you.'

#### Challenge 10

The program asks the user to input the number of letters in the alphabet. The program must then
output whether they got it correct or incorrect.

#### Challenge 11

The program asks the user to input two numbers. It will then output the larger of these two
numbers.

#### Challenge 12

Write an algorithm that:
* Generates a random number between 1 and 10.
* It must then ask the user to guess this number.
* If they guess it correctly it should display ‘Correct’
* Otherwise, display ‘Not what I was thinking’

#### Challenge 13

A company calculates holiday allowance for employees.
The company gives each employees 28 days holiday each year. Holidays are awarded based on
the following rules:

1. Full time employees who work 5 days a week get 28 days holiday a year
2. Part time employees get a proportion of holiday allowance based on how many days they
work, e.g. An employee who works 1 day a week would only get 1/5th of the holidays
allowed.

#### Challenge 14

#### Challenge 26

A dog that is 5 years old is equivalent to a 42 year old human. Ashok is writing a program which
converts the age of the dog to the equivalent age for a human.
The program uses the following method:
* The user inputs age of the dog in years
* If the age is 2 or less, the human equivalent is 12 times the age
* If the age is more hen 2, the human equivalent id 24 for the first 2 years, plus 6 for every
additional year.

#### Challenge 32

Norma would like to invest her savings in a bank account that generates the most money. She
would like a program that will allow her to:
* Enter the amount of money she wants to save.
* Input the number of bank accounts she wants to compare.
* Enter the interest rate for each account.
* The interest is calculated by dividing the money to be saved by 100 and then multiplying
this by the interest rate.
* The total is calculated by adding the money to be saved to the interest and then outputted.
* The program should repeat this for all bank accounts.
Create an algorithm for the above actions.

#### Challenge 33

Write an algorithm that:

* If their score is 40 or over it should output ‘You can go to the sixth form’
* If they their score between 35 and 39 it should output ‘A discussion is needed’
* Otherwise it should say ‘Sorry not enough points.’

#### Challenge 34

Roger has switched to a new electric supplier. He will receive free electric one day a week. He will
not pay for the day that he uses the least amount of electric. Write an algorithm that will:

* Compare them until all comparisons are completed.
Output the day that will be free of charge.

#### Challenge 35

Write an algorithm that:
* Asks the user to input many cars are available for a trip.
* Asks the user to input how many people are going on the trip.
* If there are enough seats it should output ‘We have enough seats’
* If there are not enough seats it calculates how many extra cars are needed and then output
‘Another x cars are needed’ with x being the number of cars.
NOTE: Assume you can fit FIVE people in each car.

#### Challenge 36

Petrol costs £1.40 per litre. Diesel costs £1.55 per litre. LPG costs £0.95 per litre.
* Ask the user for which type of fuel their car uses and how much they have put into it.
* Calculate the correct price of the fuel they have taken.
* Ask how much money they have handed over and calculate the amount of change they are
due.
* Finally, ask them if they have a loyalty card and if they do calculate how many points they
should have added to it using the following – 1 point for every litre of fuel they’ve taken plus
1 point for every full pound they’ve paid.
* If the number of points they get is more than 100 they get a bonus 10% extra points.
* The number of points should then be outputted

#### Challenge 37

A free drinks machine in an office provides 20 different
drinks.
The machine has a small keypad with keys 0 to 9, OK and
CANCEL. It also has a small LCD screen, which can display
a short message.
To get a drink, users select an item number between 1 and
20 with the keypad and confirm their choice by pressing OK.
If they make a mistake, they can press the CANCEL button
and start again. If the selection is valid and the drink is
available it dispenses the drink. The display screen is used
to show suitable short messages throughout the process.
Write an algorithm of the process described above

#### Challenge 38

The company also offers a saving plan. Customers pay a fixed amount each year into the savings
plan. At the end of each year, the company adds the value of the savings plan at the start of the
year to the amount paid, and then adds interest of 10% to obtain the final value for the year.
For example, if a customer saves £100 each year, the value of the savings plan for 5 years is
shown in the table below.

| Year | Start | Paid in | Interest | Final|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.00 | 100.00 | 10.00 | 110.00 |
| 2 | 110.00 | 100.00 | 21.00 | 231.00 |
| 3 | 231.00 | 100.00 | 33.10 | 364.10 |
| 4 | 364.10 | 100.00 | 46.41 | 510.51 |
| 5 | 510.51 | 100.00 | 61.05 | 671.56 |

Write an algorithm which allows the user to input the amount saved each year and the number of
years, and the outputs the growth of the savings plan in the format shown above

#### Challenge 39

A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her
students. The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in
each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask
student’s name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and
produce a final score out of 10.
Scores from the quiz should be stored and added to when a student takes a new quiz.
Write an algorithm for the process described above. 

#### Challenge 40

Write an algorithm for a game of your choice that:
* Gives the user 3 lives at the start of the game.
* Allows the user to play the game until their have no lives left.
* They should move onto the next level for every 5 points they earn.
* The game is complete when they receive 20 points.
* At the end of the game it should tell the user which level they got up to.
